# rick_project
A cross-system platform for university campus students to book rickshaws.
#Inspiration for this project
This Project was created when I was faceing sheer difficulty in getting rickshaws from hostel to classes. 
I have always have been a guy who gets things done just on time so getting up for classes have always been a task. To reach the class in time have always been a problem, there then came an idea to make this.
This have been developed using Dart - Flutter since there were both android and ios users.
